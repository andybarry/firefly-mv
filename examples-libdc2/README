This directory contains 5 programs:

grabgrey.cpp
- shows how to grab a single greyscale image from a camera
grabcolor.cpp
- shows how to grab a single color image from a camera.
Note: this is not a "bayer" image but a color image, so the camera must support
color processing, such as the Flea2.
grabbayer.cpp
- shows how to grab a single bayer image from a camera and
process it using the bayer tile processing code found in libdc-2.
grabform7.cpp
- shows how to grab a Format7 image 
grabdx.cpp
- this shows how to set up the Dragonfly Express to grab in Format7 at 200
fps.  It does a timing loop to report how fast it was able to grab images.

These programs were tested under libdc1394-2.0.0-rc3 release candidate.
Unfortunately, they have not been tested against a wide range of PGR
cameras, only Flea2, Dragonfly Express and the 2MP Scorpion.

Also included is a general purpose helper functions file pgrutils.cpp.
